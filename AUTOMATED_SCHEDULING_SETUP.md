# 🎯 Automated Survey Scheduling - Setup Checklist

## ✅ What Was Built

I've implemented a comprehensive automated survey scheduling system for your CEAL Database. Here's what you now have:

### 🔧 Core Features
- ✅ **Automated Form Opening/Closing** - Forms automatically open and close based on your schedule
- ✅ **Vercel Cron Integration** - Runs every 15 minutes to check schedules
- ✅ **Email Notifications** - Sends professional emails to all members via Resend
- ✅ **Admin Alerts** - Super admins get separate notifications with statistics
- ✅ **Status Dashboard** - Real-time view of open vs. closed libraries
- ✅ **Audit Trail** - All actions logged for accountability

### 📁 Files Created

**Database Schema:**
- `/prisma/schema/survey_session.prisma` - New SurveySession model

**API Routes:**
- `/app/api/cron/check-form-schedules/route.ts` - Cron job handler
- `/app/api/admin/survey-sessions/route.ts` - Session management API
- `/app/api/admin/form-status/route.ts` - Current status API

**Frontend:**
- `/app/(authentication)/admin/survey-schedule/page.tsx` - Scheduling UI

**Utilities:**
- `/lib/email.ts` - Enhanced with 4 new email templates
- `/lib/userUtils.ts` - Helper functions for user emails

**Configuration:**
- `/vercel.json` - Cron job configuration
- `/.env` - Updated with CRON_SECRET

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/AUTOMATED_SURVEY_SCHEDULING.md` - Complete system documentation

## 🚀 Required Setup Steps (DO THESE FIRST!)

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

Run these commands to create the SurveySession table:

```bash
# Push schema changes to database
npm run db:push

# Generate updated Prisma Client
npx prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema
```

**Why:** This creates the `SurveySession` table in your database and updates the Prisma client so TypeScript recognizes it.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

**For Local Development:**

Your `.env` file already has most variables. Just update the `CRON_SECRET`:

```bash
# Generate a random secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Then replace the CRON_SECRET in .env with the generated value
```

**For Vercel Production:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add/Update these variables:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_KgTBbcLJ_7iPNcCLWJsFyhPaBAMAXKo4g (already set)
CRON_SECRET=[your-generated-secret-from-above]
DATABASE_URL=[your-existing-database-url]
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add automated survey scheduling system"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically:
- Deploy your code
- Configure the cron job to run every 15 minutes
- Make the `/api/cron/check-form-schedules` endpoint available

### Step 4: Verify Cron Job is Running

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click "Cron Jobs" tab in the left sidebar
3. You should see: `/api/cron/check-form-schedules` scheduled for `*/15 * * * *`

**If you don't see it:** Make sure `vercel.json` exists in your repository root.

### Step 5: Test the System

1. **Sign in as Super Admin** to https://cealstats.org
2. **Navigate to:** Admin Guide → "📅 Open/Close Annual Surveys"
3. **Create a test schedule:**
   - Year: 2025
   - Opening Date: [Set to 5 minutes from now]
   - Closing Date: [Set to 10 minutes from now]
4. **Click** "Preview Email & Continue"
5. **Wait** for the cron job to run (max 15 minutes)
6. **Check** your email for the "Forms Opened" notification

## 📋 How to Use (For Super Admins)

### Creating a Schedule

1. Sign in as Super Admin
2. Go to: **Admin Guide** → **📅 Open/Close Annual Surveys**
3. Fill in:
   - **Academic Year** (e.g., 2025)
   - **Opening Date** (when forms should open)
   - **Closing Date** (when forms should close)
4. Click **"Preview Email & Continue"**
5. Done! The system handles everything else automatically.

### What Happens Automatically

**When Opening Date Arrives:**
1. ✅ All Library_Year records updated to `is_open_for_editing = true`
2. ✅ Email sent to all 160 active CEAL members
3. ✅ Separate admin notification sent to super admins
4. ✅ Action logged in audit trail
5. ✅ Form status dashboard updates

**When Closing Date Arrives:**
1. ✅ All Library_Year records updated to `is_open_for_editing = false`
2. ✅ Closure email sent to all members
3. ✅ Admin notification sent to super admins
4. ✅ Action logged in audit trail

## 🎨 UI Features

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check if Cron is Running

**Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project
2. Click "Deployments" → Latest deployment
3. Click "Functions" tab
4. Look for `/api/cron/check-form-schedules`
5. View execution logs

**Manual Trigger (for testing):**
```bash
# Development
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/check-form-schedules

# Production (requires CRON_SECRET)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" \
     https://cealstats.org/api/cron/check-form-schedules
```

### Check Database

```sql
-- View all scheduled sessions
SELECT * FROM "SurveySession" ORDER BY "academicYear" DESC;

-- Check if forms are open for a year
SELECT 
  year, 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_open_for_editing = true) as open_count
FROM "Library_Year"
WHERE year = 2025
GROUP BY year;

-- View recent audit log entries
SELECT * FROM "AuditLog" 
WHERE action IN ('SYSTEM_OPEN_FORMS', 'SYSTEM_CLOSE_FORMS')
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Email Delivery

1. Go to https://resend.com/dashboard
2. Click "Emails" in the left sidebar
3. View sent emails, delivery status, and any errors

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Forms didn't open/close automatically

**Check:**
1. ✅ Is Vercel cron configured? (Vercel dashboard → Cron Jobs)
2. ✅ Is `CRON_SECRET` set in Vercel environment variables?
3. ✅ Does the session exist in database?
4. ✅ Check Vercel function logs for errors

**Fix:**
- Verify environment variables are set
- Manually trigger cron job to test
- Check function logs for specific error messages

### Problem: Emails not being sent

**Check:**
1. ✅ Is `RESEND_API_KEY` valid?
2. ✅ Are there active users? (`SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE isactive = true`)
3. ✅ Check Resend dashboard for errors

**Fix:**
- Verify API key in Vercel environment variables
- Check Resend dashboard for quota limits
- Review function logs for email sending errors

### Problem: TypeScript errors about `surveySession`

**This is expected before running Prisma commands!**

**Fix:**
```bash
npm run db:push
npx prisma generate --schema=./prisma/schema
```

This updates the Prisma client to include the new `SurveySession` model.

## 🔄 The New Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Create Year Records with Dates
```
Navigate to: /admin/open-year

Actions:
├─ Set Year: 2025
├─ Set Opening Date: 2025-10-01
└─ Set Closing Date: 2025-12-02

Click: "Create Forms for 2025"

Database Result:
✅ 149 Library_Year records created
✅ opening_date = 2025-10-01 07:00:00 UTC (Oct 1, 12 AM PT)
✅ closing_date = 2025-12-03 07:59:59 UTC (Dec 2, 11:59 PM PT)
✅ is_open_for_editing = false (forms CLOSED)
```

### Step 2: View Session Queue
```
Navigate to: /admin/broadcast

Session Queue shows:
├─ Year 2025 (Scheduled)
├─ Opens: Oct 1, 2025
├─ Closes: Dec 2, 2025
└─ Status: Opens in X days
```

### Step 3: Preview & Send Broadcast
```
Still on: /admin/broadcast

Email Preview section:
├─ Shows scheduled session details
├─ Displays email template
└─ Button: "Continue to Send Broadcast"

Final Confirmation:
├─ Review all details
└─ Click: "Send Broadcast Now"

Result:
✅ Broadcast scheduled
✅ System will automatically:
   • Oct 1: Open forms + send emails
   • Dec 2: Close forms + send confirmation
```

## 📊 Database Schema (No Changes!)

Using existing `Library_Year` columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Library_Year" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  library INT,
  year INT,
  opening_date TIMESTAMP,        -- ✅ We use this
  closing_date TIMESTAMP,        -- ✅ We use this
  is_open_for_editing BOOLEAN,   -- ✅ Cron toggles this
  -- ... other fields
);
```

**No migration needed!** ✅

## 🧭 Overview (for librarians and administrators)

cealDB is an online system for collecting your library’s annual CEAL statistics. It guides you through ten structured forms, saves your progress safely, and clearly shows where you are in the process.

- What you can do
  - Fill out 10 survey forms (Monographic, Physical Volume Holdings, Serials, Other Holdings, Unprocessed Backlog, Fiscal Support, Personnel Support, Public Services, Electronic, Electronic Books).
  - Save Draft at any time and come back later.
  - Submit when a form is complete. Submitting locks in a “Submitted” status for the year.

- How statuses work on “My Forms”
  - Ready: You have not entered data yet for the current year.
  - Filled: You have saved data (a draft or an update exists).
  - Submitted: You clicked Submit for that form, and the system recorded it as complete for this year.

- Survey period and access
  - Your institution’s survey window (open/close dates) is shown on the admin pages.
  - If forms are closed, you’ll see “Form closed” and can no longer edit.

- What happens to your data
  - Drafts are only visible to your institution’s users.
  - Submitted data is used for the official annual statistics publication.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses a modular Prisma schema approach with separate files for different domains:

- **Monographic Acquisitions** (`monographic.prisma`) - Books and monographic materials
- **Serials** (`serials.prisma`) - Periodicals and continuing resources
- **Electronic Resources** (`electronic.prisma`) - Digital collections
- **Personnel Support** (`personnel_support.prisma`) - Staffing information
- **Fiscal Support** (`fiscal_support.prisma`) - Budget and financial data
- **Library Management** (`library.prisma`) - Library and year information

## 📝 Forms and Data Entry

### Monographic Acquisitions Form

The monographic acquisitions form allows tracking of:

- **Purchased Titles & Volumes** by language (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Non-CJK)
- **Non-Purchased Titles & Volumes** by language
- **Automatic Calculations** for subtotals and totals
- **Notes** for additional information
- **Integration** with library year data

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/monographic/create`

**Form Location**: `/admin/forms/[libid]/monographic`

### Form Validation

All forms use Zod schema validation with:
- Type-safe field definitions
- Minimum value constraints
- Required field validation
- Custom error messages

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with Turbopack

# Database
npm run prisma       # Generate client, push schema, and seed

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start           # Start production server

# Code Quality
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Submitted receipts: confirmation messages and optional email notifications after submission
- Export tools: export your submitted data to CSV/PDF for local records
- Progress tracker: visual indicators of overall completion across all forms
- Accessibility and usability: continuous improvements for keyboard and screen-reader support
- Admin dashboards: enhanced overviews for survey coordinators (open/close status, participation highlights)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Manual Deployment

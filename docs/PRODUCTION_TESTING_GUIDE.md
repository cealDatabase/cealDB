- Set dates that might trigger during business hours
- Send broadcasts to real users (use Testing Dashboard instead)

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Use year 2099 for testing
- Use Testing Dashboard for controlled tests
- Verify all changes in database before proceeding

---

## üß™ Test 1: Date Setting & Propagation

**Goal**: Verify that dates set in Survey Dates Management appear correctly throughout the system.

### Step 1.1: Create Test Year Records

1. **Navigate to**: `/admin/survey-dates`

2. **Fill in the form**:
   ```
   Academic Year: 2099
   Opening Date: 2099-01-01
   Closing Date: 2099-01-15
   ```

3. **Click**: "Create Forms for 2099"

4. **Expected Result**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Successfully opened 2099 forms!
   
   Total Libraries: 149
   New Records Created: 149 (or less if some exist)
   Existing Records Skipped: 0 (or number of existing)
   ```

### Step 1.2: Verify Database

**Option A: Using Database Tool** (Recommended)

```sql
-- Check if records were created
SELECT 
  year, 
  opening_date, 
  closing_date, 
  is_open_for_editing,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM "Library_Year"
WHERE year = 2099
GROUP BY year, opening_date, closing_date, is_open_for_editing;

-- Expected Result:
-- year: 2099
-- opening_date: 2099-01-01 07:00:00 (12 AM PT converted to UTC)
-- closing_date: 2099-01-16 07:59:59 (11:59 PM PT converted to UTC)
-- is_open_for_editing: false
-- record_count: 149
```

**Option B: Using API Endpoint**

```bash
# If you have an API endpoint to check Library_Year records
curl https://your-site.com/api/admin/library-year?year=2099
```

### Step 1.3: Verify Session Queue Display

1. **Navigate to**: `/admin/broadcast`

2. **Check "Session Queue" section**

3. **Expected Result**:
   ```
   üìÖ Session Queue
   
   Year 2099 (Scheduled)
   Opens: Jan 1, 2099
   Closes: Jan 15, 2099
   Status: Opens in X days
   Actions: [Delete Session]
   ```

### ‚úÖ Test 1 Pass Criteria

- [ ] 149 Library_Year records created for 2099

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Test 3: Broadcast Scheduling Verification

**Goal**: CRITICAL - Verify broadcast is SCHEDULED, not sent immediately

### Why This Is Critical

The system should:
- ‚úÖ Schedule the broadcast for the opening date
- ‚úÖ Keep forms CLOSED until opening date
- ‚ùå NOT send emails immediately when clicking "Schedule Broadcast"

If emails are sent immediately, this is a **bug** that must be fixed.

### Step 3.1: Schedule the Broadcast

1. **Navigate to**: `/admin/broadcast`

2. **Verify**:
   - Session appears in Session Queue
   - Email preview loads

3. **Click**: "Continue to Send Broadcast"

4. **Review confirmation page**:
   - Should show "üìÖ Scheduled Automation Summary"
   - Should show "‚úÖ What Happens Automatically"
   - Lists 4 automated events

5. **Click**: "Confirm & Schedule Broadcast"

### Step 3.2: Verify Scheduling (Not Immediate Sending)

6. **Check success message**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Broadcast Scheduled Successfully!
   Automated session for 2099 has been scheduled.
   Everything will happen automatically on the scheduled dates.
   ```

7. **CRITICAL**: Message should say **"scheduled"** not "sent"

8. **Check your email inbox**:
   - ‚úÖ **You should NOT receive any email**
   - ‚ùå If email received ‚Üí **STOP** ‚Üí System has a bug

### Step 3.3: Verify Forms Stay Closed

9. **Navigate to**: `/admin/broadcast`

10. **Check "Current Form Status"**:
    ```
    Year: 2099
    Total Libraries: 149
    Open for Editing: 0       ‚Üê MUST be 0
    Closed: 149               ‚Üê MUST be 149
    ```

11. **Check Session Queue**:
    ```
    Year 2099 (Scheduled)
    Status: Opens in X days   ‚Üê Shows future status
    ```

### ‚úÖ Test 3 Pass Criteria

- [ ] Success message says "scheduled" (NOT "sent")
- [ ] NO email received immediately
- [ ] Forms show: 0 open, 149 closed
- [ ] Session Queue shows "Scheduled" status

### ‚ùå If Test 3 Fails

**If you receive email immediately**:
1. Check `/app/api/admin/broadcast/route.ts`
2. Should NOT call `resend.broadcasts.create()` immediately
3. Should set `is_open_for_editing: false`
4. Redeploy and retest

**If forms open immediately**:
1. Check database: `is_open_for_editing` should be `false`
2. Check API response: status should be "scheduled"
3. Review recent code changes

---

## üî¨ Test 4: Manual Form Opening (Testing Dashboard)

**Goal**: Test CRON simulation without waiting for actual dates or sending to real users

### Step 3.1: Access Testing Dashboard

1. **Navigate to**: `/admin/testing`

2. **Expected**: Testing dashboard interface

### Step 3.2: Configure Test

1. **Fill in form**:
   ```
   Year: 2099
   Test Mode: ‚úÖ ENABLED (check the box)
   Test Emails: your-email@example.com
   ```

2. **Important**: Make sure "Test Mode" checkbox is **CHECKED**
   - This prevents sending to real users
   - Emails only go to addresses in "Test Emails" field

### Step 3.3: Test Open Forms

1. **Click**: "Test Open Forms"

2. **Expected Result**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Success
   Opened 149 forms for year 2099
   Email sent to: your-email@example.com
   ```

3. **Check your email**:
   - Should receive broadcast email
   - Should mention year 2099
   - Should have opening/closing dates

### Step 3.4: Verify Forms Opened

**Check database**:

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as open_forms,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN is_open_for_editing = true THEN 1 END) as open_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN is_open_for_editing = false THEN 1 END) as closed_count
FROM "Library_Year"
WHERE year = 2099;

-- Expected Result:
-- open_count: 149
-- closed_count: 0
```

**OR check via UI**:

1. Go to `/admin/broadcast`
2. Check "Current Form Status"
3. Should show:
   ```
   Year: 2099
   Total Libraries: 149
   Open for Editing: 149
   Closed: 0
   ```

### Step 3.5: Test Close Forms

1. **Still on**: `/admin/testing`

2. **Click**: "Test Close Forms"

3. **Expected Result**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Success
   Closed 149 forms for year 2099
   ```

4. **Verify**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) as closed_forms
   FROM "Library_Year"
   WHERE year = 2099 AND is_open_for_editing = false;
   
   -- Expected: 149
   ```

### ‚úÖ Test 3 Pass Criteria

- [ ] Testing Dashboard accessible
- [ ] Test Mode checkbox works
- [ ] "Test Open Forms" opens all 149 forms
- [ ] Email received with correct content
- [ ] "Test Close Forms" closes all 149 forms
- [ ] No emails sent to real users (only test email)

## ‚è∞ Test 5: CRON Job Simulation

**Goal**: Test CRON automation without waiting for actual dates.

### Background: How CRON Works

The system has a CRON job that runs every hour:

```typescript
// Checks every hour for:
1. Sessions that should open (opening_date <= now)
2. Sessions that should close (closing_date <= now)
```

### Option A: Using Testing Dashboard (Recommended)

**This is the safest method** - already tested in Test 3 above.

The Testing Dashboard's "Test Open Forms" and "Test Close Forms" buttons simulate exactly what the CRON job does, but triggered manually.

‚úÖ **This method is sufficient** for testing CRON functionality.

### Option B: Set Near-Future Dates (Advanced)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use with caution** - Only if you want to test actual CRON triggering.

1. **Set dates 2 hours in the future**:
   ```
   Opening Date: Today + 2 hours
   Closing Date: Today + 3 hours
   ```

2. **Create records** via Survey Dates Management

3. **Wait for CRON to run** (runs every hour on Vercel)

4. **Monitor**:
   - Check Vercel CRON logs
   - Check database for changes
   - Check email inbox

5. **Expected**:
   - After 2 hours: Forms open, broadcast sent
   - After 3 hours: Forms close, confirmation sent

### Option C: Trigger CRON Manually (If Available)

If you have access to trigger Vercel CRON manually:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Cron Jobs
2. Find the "open-forms" cron
3. Click "Trigger" to run immediately
4. Verify results

### ‚úÖ Test 4 Pass Criteria

**If using Option A (Testing Dashboard)**:
- [ ] Already verified in Test 3 ‚úÖ

**If using Option B (Near-Future Dates)**:
- [ ] CRON opens forms at scheduled time
- [ ] Broadcast email sent on opening
- [ ] CRON closes forms at scheduled time
- [ ] Confirmation email sent on closing

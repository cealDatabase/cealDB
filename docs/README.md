# 📚 Testing Documentation - Complete Guide

**Last Updated**: October 13, 2025

Welcome to the comprehensive testing documentation for the Survey Dates Management and Broadcast system.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**First time testing?** → Read this first!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Broadcast Scheduling Behavior

**The system SCHEDULES broadcasts - it does NOT send them immediately!**

When you click "Confirm & Schedule Broadcast":
- ✅ Session is saved to database with scheduled dates
- ✅ Forms remain CLOSED until opening date
- ✅ NO email is sent immediately
- ✅ CRON job will open forms AND send emails on the opening date

**If you receive an email immediately** → System has a bug!

## 🎯 What You'll Test

### Core Functionality

1. **Survey Dates Management** (`/admin/survey-dates`)
   - Create Library_Year records
   - Set opening and closing dates
   - Dates stored in Pacific Time

2. **Broadcast Scheduling** (`/admin/broadcast`)
   - Schedule broadcast for opening date
   - Preview email template
   - Verify forms stay closed

3. **Testing Dashboard** (`/admin/testing`)
   - Simulate CRON job (open forms)
   - Simulate CRON job (close forms)
   - Test emails safely

4. **CRON Automation** (automatic)
   - Opens forms on opening date
   - Sends broadcast on opening date
   - Closes forms on closing date

---

## ✅ 8-Step Testing Process

### Quick Overview

```
Step 1: Create Session (Survey Dates Management)
   → Year: 2099, Dates: 2099-01-01 to 2099-01-15

Step 2: Verify Session Queue (Broadcast Page)
   → Session appears with scheduled dates

Step 3: Preview Email (Broadcast Page)
   → Email template loads correctly

Step 4: Schedule Broadcast ⚠️ CRITICAL
   → Click "Schedule Broadcast"
   → NO email received (this is correct!)
   → Forms stay CLOSED (0 open, 149 closed)

Step 5: Test CRON Simulation (Testing Dashboard)
   → Test Mode: ✅ ON
   → Opens forms manually
   → Email received

Step 6: Verify Forms Open (Broadcast Page)
   → 149 open, 0 closed

Step 7: Test Close (Testing Dashboard)
   → Closes forms manually

Step 8: Cleanup (Broadcast Page)
   → Delete session for year 2099
```

**Total Time**: ~20 minutes

## 🔍 Critical Tests

### ⚠️ Must-Pass Tests

1. **Scheduling Verification**
   - Click "Schedule Broadcast" → NO email sent
   - Forms stay closed (0 open, 149 closed)
   - Message says "scheduled" not "sent"

2. **CRON Simulation**
   - Testing Dashboard opens forms
   - Testing Dashboard sends test email
   - Email content is accurate

3. **Date Propagation**
   - Dates set in Survey Dates Management
   - Dates appear in Broadcast Session Queue
   - Dates stored correctly in database

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Safe Testing with Year 2099

**Always use year 2099 for testing**:
- ✅ Won't conflict with production data
- ✅ Easy to identify test data
- ✅ Safe to delete after testing

**Never use current year** (2025, 2026, etc.) for testing:
- ❌ Could affect production
- ❌ Hard to distinguish from real data
- ❌ Risk of confusion

### Test Mode

**Always enable Test Mode** in Testing Dashboard:
- ✅ Emails only to test addresses
- ✅ No risk to real users
- ✅ Safe for repeated testing

---

## 📋 Updated Testing Steps (October 2025)

### What Changed

**OLD Behavior** (Before October 13, 2025):
- Clicking "Send Broadcast" sent emails immediately
- Forms opened immediately
- Broadcast sent to all users right away

**NEW Behavior** (After October 13, 2025):
- Clicking "Schedule Broadcast" only saves schedule
- Forms stay CLOSED until opening date
- CRON sends broadcast on opening date
- True automated scheduling

### Testing Updates

All documentation has been updated to reflect:
1. ✅ Broadcast scheduling (not immediate sending)
2. ✅ Forms staying closed until CRON runs
3. ✅ Critical Step 4: Verify NO email sent
4. ✅ Testing Dashboard simulates CRON
5. ✅ 8 steps instead of 7 (added scheduling verification)

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: Email Sent Immediately

**Symptom**: Receive email right after clicking "Schedule Broadcast"

**Solution**: 
1. This is a BUG - system should NOT send immediately
2. Check `/app/api/admin/broadcast/route.ts`
3. Should NOT call Resend API immediately
4. Should set `is_open_for_editing: false`
5. See [BROADCAST_SCHEDULING_VERIFICATION.md](./BROADCAST_SCHEDULING_VERIFICATION.md)

### Issue: Forms Open Immediately

**Symptom**: Database shows `is_open_for_editing = true` after scheduling

**Solution**:
1. This is a BUG - forms should stay CLOSED
2. Check API sets `is_open_for_editing: false`
3. CRON should open forms, not the API

### Issue: Session Not Appearing

**Symptom**: Session Queue shows "No pending sessions"

**Solution**:
1. Verify records created in Survey Dates Management
2. Check database for Library_Year records
3. Recreate session if needed

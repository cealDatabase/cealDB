SELECT 
  year,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_open_for_editing = true) as open_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_open_for_editing = false) as closed_count
FROM "Library_Year"
WHERE year = 2025
GROUP BY year;
```

**Check Audit Log**:
```sql
SELECT 
  action,
  table_name,
  new_values,
  created_at
FROM "AuditLog"
WHERE action IN ('TEST_OPEN_FORMS', 'TEST_CLOSE_FORMS')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check Session Schedule**:
```sql
SELECT 
  year,
  opening_date,
  closing_date,
  is_open_for_editing
FROM "Library_Year"
WHERE year = 2025
  AND (opening_date IS NOT NULL OR closing_date IS NOT NULL)
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 6. Session Queue Component
**Location**: `/admin/broadcast` ‚Üí Session Queue section

**Check**:
- Scheduled sessions
- Active sessions
- Recently closed sessions

**Status Indicators**:
- üîµ **Scheduled** - Forms will open in future
- üü¢ **Active** - Currently open
- ‚ö™ **Recently Closed** - Closed within 30 days

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Test Mode vs Production Mode

### Test Mode (ENABLED) ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**What Happens**:
- Emails sent ONLY to specified test email addresses
- If no test emails provided, only super admins receive emails
- Database changes still affect ALL records
- Safe for testing without spamming users

**Use When**:
- Testing email templates
- Verifying email delivery
- Checking broadcast functionality
- Initial testing on Vercel

**Example**:
```
Test Mode: ‚úÖ ENABLED
Test Emails: test@example.com
Result: Only test@example.com receives email
Database: All 149 forms opened
```

---

### Production Mode (DISABLED) ‚ö†Ô∏è USE WITH CAUTION

**What Happens**:
- Emails sent to ALL active users in database
- All real users receive the broadcast
- Database changes affect all records
- **This is the real thing!**

**Use When**:
- Actually opening forms for real
- Actually closing forms for real
- Ready for production broadcast
- After testing is complete

**Warning**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION MODE ENABLED
This will send emails to ALL users!
Proceed with caution.
```

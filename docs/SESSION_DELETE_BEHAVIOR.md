# Session Delete Behavior

## Important: Deleting Sessions Does NOT Change Form Status

### Key Principle

**When you delete a session from the Session Queue, it ONLY clears the schedule dates. It does NOT change whether forms are currently open or closed.**

## What Gets Deleted

When deleting a session, the system clears these fields:
- ‚úÖ `opening_date` ‚Üí set to `null`
- ‚úÖ `closing_date` ‚Üí set to `null`
- ‚úÖ `fiscal_year_start` ‚Üí set to `null`
- ‚úÖ `fiscal_year_end` ‚Üí set to `null`
- ‚úÖ `publication_date` ‚Üí set to `null`

## What Does NOT Change

- ‚ùå `is_open_for_editing` ‚Üí **UNCHANGED**
- ‚ùå Library_Year records ‚Üí remain intact
- ‚ùå Form data ‚Üí preserved
- ‚ùå Library associations ‚Üí unchanged

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete Active Session (Forms Currently Open)

**Before Deletion**:
- Session Queue: Year 2025 (Active)
- Forms Status: 149 libraries OPEN for editing
- Schedule: Opens Oct 14, Closes Dec 16

**Delete Action**: Click delete button, confirm

**After Deletion**:
- Session Queue: Year 2025 removed from queue
- Forms Status: 149 libraries STILL OPEN for editing ‚úÖ
- Schedule: No dates (cleared)

**Result**: Forms remain open! Admin must manually close them if desired.

### Scenario 2: Delete Scheduled Session (Forms Not Yet Open)

**Before Deletion**:
- Session Queue: Year 2025 (Scheduled, opens in 5 days)
- Forms Status: 149 libraries CLOSED
- Schedule: Opens Oct 14, Closes Dec 16

**Delete Action**: Click delete button, confirm

**After Deletion**:
- Session Queue: Year 2025 removed from queue
- Forms Status: 149 libraries STILL CLOSED ‚úÖ
- Schedule: No dates (cleared)

**Result**: Forms remain closed. They will NOT automatically open on Oct 14.

### Scenario 3: Delete After Forms Already Closed

**Before Deletion**:
- Session Queue: Year 2025 (Recently Closed)
- Forms Status: 149 libraries CLOSED
- Schedule: Opened Oct 14, Closed Dec 16

**Delete Action**: Click delete button, confirm

**After Deletion**:
- Session Queue: Year 2025 removed from queue
- Forms Status: 149 libraries STILL CLOSED ‚úÖ
- Schedule: No dates (cleared)

**Result**: Forms remain closed.

## Why This Design?

### 1. **Flexibility**
Super admins can reschedule without disrupting current form access.

### 2. **Safety**
Accidentally deleting a schedule won't close forms that are currently being used.

### 3. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Schedule Management**: Opening/closing dates
- **Form Access Control**: Open/closed status
- These are independent operations

### 4. **Manual Override Support**
If forms were manually opened (outside of schedule), deleting the schedule won't undo that.

## How to Close Forms

If you want to close forms after deleting a schedule:

### Option 1: Use "Close All Forms" Button
1. Navigate to Open/Close Annual Surveys page
2. Find "Current Form Status" section
3. Click "Close All Forms" button
4. Confirm action

### Option 2: Create New Session with Past Closing Date
1. Delete existing session
2. Create new session with closing date in the past
3. Cron job will automatically close forms

### Option 3: Manual Database Update
```sql
UPDATE "Library_Year"
SET is_open_for_editing = false
WHERE year = 2025;
```

## Confirmation Dialog

When deleting a session, you'll see different messages based on status:

### For Active Sessions:
```
Are you sure you want to delete the scheduled session for year 2025?

This will remove the schedule dates but will NOT change the current 
open/closed status of forms.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Forms are currently OPEN. Deleting the schedule will NOT close 
them - they will remain open.

This action cannot be undone.
```

### For Scheduled/Closed Sessions:
```
Are you sure you want to delete the scheduled session for year 2025?

This will remove the schedule dates but will NOT change the current 
open/closed status of forms.

This action cannot be undone.
```

## API Response

When you delete a session, the API returns status information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "year": 2025,
  "recordsCleared": 149,
  "formsStatus": {
    "open": 149,
    "closed": 0,
    "note": "Form status unchanged - only schedule dates cleared"
  },
  "message": "Scheduled session for year 2025 has been deleted. Forms remain in their current state."
}
```

## Logging

The system logs the deletion with status information:

```
üìã Deleting session for year 2025: 149 forms open, 0 forms closed
‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: Form open/closed status will NOT be changed, only schedule dates will be cleared
‚úÖ Deleted scheduled session for year 2025, cleared 149 records
‚úÖ Forms retained their status: 149 remain open, 0 remain closed
```

## Common Misconceptions

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Deleting a scheduled session cancels the opening"
**‚úÖ CORRECT**: Deleting removes the schedule. If forms are already open, they stay open.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "I need to close forms before deleting the schedule"
**‚úÖ CORRECT**: You can delete at any time. Form status is preserved.

### ‚ùå WRONG: "Deleting an active session will close all forms"
**‚úÖ CORRECT**: Forms remain in their current state. Use "Close All Forms" button to close them.

## Best Practices

1. **Check Current Status**: Before deleting, note whether forms are open or closed
2. **Close if Needed**: If forms are open and you want them closed, use "Close All Forms" first
3. **Verify After Delete**: Check "Current Form Status" to confirm forms are in desired state
4. **Clear Communication**: Inform users if forms will remain open after schedule deletion

Environment Configuration
❌ MISSING: You don't have SYNC_AUTH_TABLES in your 
.env
 file, but this is actually PERFECT because:

Without the variable: Defaults to false (preserves auth tables) ✅
This is exactly what you want for normal operations

🎯 What To Do Next
Option 1: Use Default Behavior (Recommended)
bash
# Just run the seed - it will preserve your auth tables by default
`npm run db:seed`

Option 2: Explicitly Set Environment Variable (Optional)
If you want to be explicit, add this to your 
.env
 file:
.env

🚀 Ready to Execute
Your implementation is perfect! Here's exactly what will happen when you run the seed:

Normal Sync (Preserves Auth Data)
bash
`npm run db:seed`
What happens:

✅ Fetches library data, surveys, reference tables from ceal schema
✅ SKIPS User, User_Library, Users_Roles tables from ceal
✅ PRESERVES all authentication data in 

public
 schema
✅ Shows safety warnings and data inventory
✅ Your users stay logged in with their existing passwords
Emergency Full Sync (Nuclear Option)
bash

`SYNC_AUTH_TABLES=true npm run db:seed`

Use only if you need to completely restore from ceal

📋 Verification Steps
After running the normal sync, verify it worked correctly:

Check console output - should show "User data will be preserved"
Test user login - existing users should still be able to log in
Check data restoration - library/survey data should be updated from ceal
Your setup is production-ready and will safely preserve your authentication data while restoring corrupted library data from the ceal schema! 🎉
